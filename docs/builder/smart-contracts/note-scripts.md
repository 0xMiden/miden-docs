# Note Scripts

Note scripts define the logic that executes when a note is consumed. They determine **who** can consume a note and **what happens** to its assets.

## What you'll learn

- The `#[note]` struct + impl pattern
- `#[note_script]` method requirements and signature flexibility
- Accessing note inputs via struct fields
- Cross-component calls from note scripts
- Complete examples from the compiler

## The `#[note]` pattern

A note script consists of a struct (holding note inputs) and an impl block with a `#[note_script]` method:

```rust
use miden::{AccountId, Word, active_note, note};

#[note]
struct P2idNote {
    target_account_id: AccountId,
}

#[note]
impl P2idNote {
    #[note_script]
    pub fn run(self, _arg: Word, account: &mut Account) {
        // Script logic here
    }
}
```

The `#[note]` macro:
1. Generates the WIT note-script interface
2. Deserializes note inputs into struct fields
3. Exports the `run` function as the note's entry point

## Struct fields as note inputs

Fields on the `#[note]` struct are populated from the note's input data when the note is consumed:

```rust
#[note]
struct MyNote {
    target_account_id: AccountId,  // Deserialized from note inputs
}
```

The compiler maps struct fields to note inputs based on their order and type. Supported field types include `AccountId`, `Felt`, `Word`, and other SDK types.

If you don't need inputs, use a unit struct:

```rust
#[note]
struct CounterNote;
```

## `#[note_script]` method requirements

The `#[note_script]` method has specific signature constraints:

| Constraint | Details |
|------------|---------|
| Receiver | `self` (by value only — not `&self` or `&mut self`) |
| Return type | `()` |
| Required arg | One `Word` argument (the note script argument) |
| Optional arg | `&Account` or `&mut Account` (the consuming account) |
| Generics | Not allowed |
| Async | Not allowed |

### Parameter ordering

The `Word` and `&mut Account` parameters can appear in either order:

```rust
// Both are valid:
pub fn run(self, _arg: Word, account: &mut Account) { ... }
pub fn run(self, account: &mut Account, _arg: Word) { ... }
```

### With account access

When you include `&mut Account` (or `&Account`), the note script can call methods on the consuming account's components:

```rust
#[note_script]
pub fn run(self, _arg: Word, account: &mut Account) {
    let assets = active_note::get_assets();
    for asset in assets {
        account.receive_asset(asset);  // Cross-component call
    }
}
```

The `Account` type comes from WIT bindings of the account component — see [Cross-Component Calls](./cross-component-calls).

### Without account access

If the note script doesn't need to interact with the account:

```rust
#[note_script]
pub fn run(self, _arg: Word) {
    // Can still read note data via active_note
    let assets = active_note::get_assets();
    // But cannot call account methods
}
```

## Example: P2ID (Pay to ID)

A note that can only be consumed by a specific account, transferring all assets:

```rust title="p2id-note/src/lib.rs"
#![no_std]
#![feature(alloc_error_handler)]

use miden::{AccountId, Word, active_note, note};

use crate::bindings::Account;

#[note]
struct P2idNote {
    target_account_id: AccountId,
}

#[note]
impl P2idNote {
    #[note_script]
    pub fn run(self, _arg: Word, account: &mut Account) {
        let current_account = account.get_id();
        assert_eq!(current_account, self.target_account_id);

        let assets = active_note::get_assets();
        for asset in assets {
            account.receive_asset(asset);
        }
    }
}
```

```toml title="p2id-note/Cargo.toml"
[package]
name = "p2id"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2024"

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
miden = { path = "../../sdk/sdk" }

[package.metadata.component]
package = "miden:p2id"

[package.metadata.miden]
project-kind = "note-script"

# Declare the account component this note interacts with
[package.metadata.miden.dependencies]
"miden:basic-wallet" = { path = "../basic-wallet" }

[package.metadata.component.target.dependencies]
"miden:basic-wallet" = { path = "../basic-wallet/target/generated-wit/" }
```

## Example: Counter note (cross-component calls)

A note that calls methods on the consuming account's component:

```rust title="counter-note/src/lib.rs"
#![no_std]
#![feature(alloc_error_handler)]

use miden::*;

use crate::bindings::miden::counter_contract::counter_contract;

#[note]
struct CounterNote;

#[note]
impl CounterNote {
    #[note_script]
    pub fn run(self, _arg: Word) {
        let initial_value = counter_contract::get_count();
        counter_contract::increment_count();
        let expected_value = initial_value + Felt::from_u32(1);
        let final_value = counter_contract::get_count();
        assert_eq(final_value, expected_value);
    }
}
```

This note doesn't take `&mut Account` — instead it calls the counter contract's methods directly through generated bindings. See [Cross-Component Calls](./cross-component-calls).

## Cargo.toml for note scripts

Note scripts require `project-kind = "note-script"` and must declare dependencies on any account components they interact with:

```toml
[package.metadata.miden]
project-kind = "note-script"

# Miden dependencies — account components this note calls
[package.metadata.miden.dependencies]
"miden:basic-wallet" = { path = "../basic-wallet" }

# WIT dependencies — generated interfaces for cross-component calls
[package.metadata.component.target.dependencies]
"miden:basic-wallet" = { path = "../basic-wallet/target/generated-wit/" }
```
