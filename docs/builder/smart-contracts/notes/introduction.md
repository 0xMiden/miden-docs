# What are Notes?

Notes are Miden's mechanism for transferring assets between accounts. Like UTXOs, notes are created and consumed atomically (not partially spent). Unlike Bitcoin's UTXOs, each Miden note carries an arbitrary executable script — written in Rust — that runs when the note is consumed, enabling programmable conditions far beyond simple locking scripts.

Assets never transfer directly between accounts. Instead, they always move through notes. This indirection is what makes Miden private: the network sees notes being created and consumed, but it can't link sender and recipient accounts because those operations happen in separate transactions.

## Anatomy of a note

Every note has four parts:

| Part | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Assets** | The fungible or non-fungible tokens the note carries |
| **Script** | Code that executes when the note is consumed — determines who can claim it and what side effects occur |
| **Inputs** | Custom data the script can read at consumption time (e.g., a target account ID, an expiration block) |
| **Metadata** | Sender ID, note tag (for discovery routing), and auxiliary data |

The **recipient** is a cryptographic hash that encodes who can consume the note. When creating notes programmatically (via [`output_note::create`](./output-notes#create-a-note)), you compute a `Recipient` from the note's serial number, script hash, and inputs:

```
recipient = hash(hash(hash(serial_num, [0;4]), script_root), inputs_commitment)
```

Only someone who knows these values can construct a valid consumption proof. See [Computing a Recipient](./output-notes#computing-a-recipient) for the SDK API.

## The two-transaction model

Unlike Ethereum where a transfer is a single atomic call, Miden transfers happen across two separate transactions:

```
Transaction 1 (Sender)                Transaction 2 (Recipient)
┌─────────────────────────┐            ┌─────────────────────────┐
│ 1. Create note           │            │ 1. Discover note         │
│ 2. Attach assets         │            │ 2. Consume note          │
│ 3. Note published        │──────────▶│ 3. Script runs           │
│    (on-chain or private) │            │ 4. Assets move to vault  │
│                          │            │ 5. Note nullified        │
└─────────────────────────┘            └─────────────────────────┘
```

**Transaction 1**: The sender's account creates an output note, attaches assets to it, and the note is published (either on-chain or kept private).

**Transaction 2**: The recipient discovers the note, consumes it in their own transaction, the note script runs and verifies the consumer is authorized, and assets transfer into the recipient's vault. A **nullifier** is recorded to prevent the same note from being consumed again.

This separation is what enables privacy and parallelism — the two transactions are independent and unlinkable from the network's perspective.

## Public vs. private notes

Notes come in two visibility modes:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Public** | The note's full data (assets, script, inputs) is stored by the Miden network and visible on-chain. Anyone can discover and attempt to consume it. |
| **Private** | Only a commitment (hash) is stored on-chain. The actual note data must be communicated off-chain between sender and recipient. |

Private notes provide stronger privacy guarantees — the network can't even see what assets a note carries — but they require the sender and recipient to have a communication channel outside the protocol.

Miden provides built-in note patterns (P2ID, P2IDE, SWAP) for common transfer scenarios — see [Note Types](./note-types.md). You can also write fully custom note scripts for arbitrary consumption logic.

## How notes differ from EVM transfers

| | EVM | Miden |
|---|---|---|
| **Transfer model** | Single `transfer()` call on a token contract | Two transactions: create note, then consume note |
| **Privacy** | Sender, recipient, and amount are public | Transactions are unlinkable; private notes hide all data |
| **Programmability** | Token contracts control transfer logic | Each note carries its own script with custom conditions |
| **Failure** | Revert on-chain, gas consumed | Proof can't be generated — no on-chain trace |
| **Parallelism** | Transfers contend for contract state | Notes are independent — unlimited parallel creation |
