# miden-docs

This is an umbrelle docs repo that will import docs from `miden-base`, `miden-client`, `miden-node`, `miden-compiler`, and `miden-crypto` and more.

Until the satellite branches are published, I cannot test with the Miden docs themselves, so this is a demo currently.

Please see the `mkdocs.yml` file `nav` section and related `plugin` section which shows how you build the navigation menu and import the satellite repos the docs come from.

## Spin up the site

Make sure you have Python 12: `python --version`.

Run the `run.sh` file from the directory root which brings everything up.

Access the local site at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.
