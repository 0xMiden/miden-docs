# Building a Bank with Miden Rust

Welcome to the **Miden Rust Compiler Tutorial**! This hands-on guide teaches you how to build smart contracts on Miden using Rust by walking through a complete banking application.

## What You'll Build

You'll create a **banking system** consisting of:

- **Bank Account Component**: A smart contract that manages depositor balances and vault operations
- **Deposit Note**: A note script that processes deposits into the bank
- **Withdraw Request Note**: A note script that requests withdrawals from the bank
- **Initialization Script**: A transaction script to deploy and initialize the bank

Each part ends with a **runnable MockChain test** that verifies what you built works correctly.

## Tutorial Structure

This tutorial is designed for hands-on learning. Each part builds on the previous one, and every part includes:

- **What You'll Build** - Clear objectives for the section
- **Step-by-step code** - Progressively building functionality
- **Try It section** - A MockChain test to verify your code works
- **Complete code** - Full code listing for reference

### Parts Overview

| **Part 2** | [Constants & Constraints](./constants-constraints) | Business rules and validation |
| **Part 3** | [Asset Management](./asset-management) | Deposit logic with balance tracking |
| **Part 4** | [Note Scripts](./note-scripts) | Deposit note for receiving assets |

| **Part 6** | [Transaction Scripts](./transaction-scripts) | Initialization script |
| **Part 7** | [Output Notes](./output-notes) | Withdraw with P2ID output |
| **Part 8** | [Complete Flows](./complete-flows) | End-to-end verification |

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have:

- Completed the [Quick Start guide](../../../../quick-start/) (familiarity with `midenup`, `miden new`, basic tooling)
- Basic understanding of Miden concepts (accounts, notes, transactions)
- Rust programming experience

:::tip No Miden Rust Experience Required
This tutorial assumes no prior experience with the Miden Rust compiler. We'll explain each concept as we encounter it.
