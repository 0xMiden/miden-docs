# ============================================================
# ARCHITECTURE NOTE:
# This workflow is RENDER-ONLY. It builds and deploys using:
#   - docs/ (Builder-authored content only)
#   - versioned_docs/ (Design, Tutorials, Client, Quick Start)
#
# External repo ingestion happens ONLY in cut-versions.yml.
# DO NOT add vendor checkouts or docs aggregation here.
#
# The canonical-source architecture:
#   - Builder content: authored in docs/builder/
#   - Design/Tutorials/Client: ingested into versioned_docs/ during version cuts
#   - docs/ must never contain miden-base, miden-vm, miden-node, etc.
