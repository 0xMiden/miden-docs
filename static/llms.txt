# Miden Documentation

> Miden is a zero-knowledge rollup for Ethereum that enables private, scalable smart contracts using STARK proofs. Build applications with account-based state, note-based transactions, and client-side proving.

## Quick Start

Get up and running with Miden in minutes.

- [Installation](/builder/quick-start/setup/installation): Install the Miden toolchain using `midenup`
- [CLI Basics](/builder/quick-start/setup/cli-basics): Create your first wallet and mint tokens
- [Accounts](/builder/quick-start/accounts): Understand Miden's account model
- [Notes & Transactions](/builder/quick-start/notes): Learn note-based transaction flow
- [Read Storage](/builder/quick-start/read-storage): Query on-chain state

## Your First Smart Contract

Build, test, and deploy a contract on Miden.

- [Create a Contract](/builder/quick-start/your-first-smart-contract/create): Write your first Miden smart contract in Rust
- [Test Locally](/builder/quick-start/your-first-smart-contract/test): Run tests with the Miden testing framework
- [Deploy](/builder/quick-start/your-first-smart-contract/deploy): Deploy your contract to Miden

## Core Concepts

Understand the fundamentals of building on Miden.

- [Accounts](/builder/core-concepts): Miden uses an account-based state model with STARK-provable execution
- [Notes](/builder/core-concepts): Transactions consume and produce notes (UTXOs with attached scripts)
- [Assets](/builder/core-concepts): Native and custom fungible/non-fungible assets
- [Transactions](/builder/core-concepts): Client-side proven transactions with privacy guarantees

## Smart Contracts (Miden in Rust)

Write smart contracts in Rust that compile to Miden Assembly.

- [Smart Contracts Guide](/builder/smart-contracts): The "Miden in Rust" guide for contract development
- [Account Components](/builder/smart-contracts): Build reusable account components
- [Note Scripts](/builder/smart-contracts): Create custom note scripts for complex logic

## Developer Tools

- [Rust Client](/builder/tools): Programmatic access to Miden network
- [Web Client](/builder/tools): Browser-based Miden interactions
- [Playground](/builder/tools): Interactive Miden Assembly explorer
- [Block Explorer](/builder/tools): View transactions and accounts
